=== INSTALLATION ===

 * Ensure SMAPI and Content Patcher are installed.
 * Download the mod using the "Download with Manager" link on Nexus Mods.
 * Install and activate the mod in Nexus Vortex.
 * (Optional) After first launch, navigate to the mod directory using
   Open > Open Game Mods Folder > CombinedGirlMod and edit config.json to change settings as described
   in the Configuration section below.

 * Unzip the mod package into it's own directory.
 * Place unzipped directory into your Stardew Valley/Mods directory.

=== CONFIGURATION ===

In config.json, the following values are accepted:

Alex, Elliott, Shane, and Sebastian: Adarin, Adarin Variant, Dialogue Only, Disabled
Harvey, Sam: Adarin, Dialogue Only, Disabled
Shane: Exrenkon, Lydomia, Dialogue Only, Disabled

I highly recommend using the Generic Mod Config Menu mod to edit these values:
